DIV BLASTER v1.0

An asteroid blaster game where a user controls the movement of a ship and can fire rockets at falling asteroids. Destroying asteroids will increase the user’s score, inversely proportional to the asteroid’s size, since the smaller ones are more difficult to hit. The user gets 3 lives which get lost upon collision with an asteroid, and can acquire a shield to protect from a single collision.

CONTROLS
 
Arrow keys: movement
Spacebar: fire a rocket

SETTINGS
 
Users can control the asteroid spawn rate and mute/unmute the audio in the settings menu. Changes are only applied once the Update Settings is clicked.
